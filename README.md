# Hello World!

This project is written on my knee in 5 seconds, I decided to make it because I just LOVE minimalism, I hate it when something extra sticks out and the code looks very nice.

Now about how to use the project, you can clone the repository and install libraries such as.

1) Aiogram 
2) requests

In config.py file you can change emoji, yes there can be a lot of them in the captcha, after that for each emoji you can create an image to send them to the bot and get an idi file in app/handler file. py I commented out the function "get_file_id_photo" to get the file id of the photo, the message sent by the bot is fully clickable and when you click on it, it will be copied together with apostrophes, you just need to create variables and paste the received message into it and done, you have a perfect captcha!

P.S hope you find this project useful, don't forget to set your bot token!) Good luck!
